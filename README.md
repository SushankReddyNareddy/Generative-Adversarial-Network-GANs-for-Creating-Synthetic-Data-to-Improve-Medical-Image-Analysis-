# Generative-Adversarial-Network-GANs-for-Creating-Synthetic-Data-to-Improve-Medical-Image-Analysis-
This project uses GANs (CycleGAN &amp; Pix2Pix) to generate synthetic chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues. It enhances medical image analysis by improving model accuracy and generalization using CNN and U-Net on real + synthetic data.
